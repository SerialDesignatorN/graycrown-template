# Graycrown
A simple game launcher for games on Windows, Linux

# Why the old Coal repository?
After AB Studios has issued cease and desist letter to me, I have no choice but to rebrand it. With the old code written from scratch, Graycrown is now the base of AB Coal's source code such as game launching.

Yes, it's the old Coal I made, but with a different name

# Dang, how to run this shiny branded launcher?
Easy, just have Node.js installed and npm.
Then run these commands
```
npm i
```
```
npm start
```
Self-build the binaries? No problem! Run the `build` command instead!
```
npm run build
```
